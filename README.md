# Analyzing-Music-Streaming-Behavior

In the context of this project, a hypothesis related to the music preferences of two cities will be tested. This will be done by analyzing real online music streaming data to test the hypothesis below and compare the behavior of users in these two cities.

This will involve analyzing real online music streaming data to compare the behavior of users in Springfield and Shelbyville. The project will be divided into three stages, each with specific objectives.

In Stage 1, an overview of the data will be provided, and observations will be noted. In Stage 2, the data will be preprocessed by cleaning it. Finally, in Stage 3, the hypothesis will be tested by following the necessary programming steps to test each statement and commenting on the results in the appropriate blocks.

Upon completing these stages, valuable insights will be extracted from the data, allowing for data-driven decision-making.
